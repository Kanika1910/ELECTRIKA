    <p>In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.
        In cases where a product accessory is found missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either process a replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller’s discretion.
        During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders).
         Once you have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be processed, except for manufacturing defects. 
         In such cases, these category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be applicable.
